I offer this positionality statement as a recognition of my lived
experiences, responsibilities, background knowledge, and cultural
grounding that shape my approach to this research. I am a Nêhiyaw (Cree)
member of the Muskoday First Nation (MFN). On my mother’s side of the
family comes from MFN through her late father, Lloyd Bear, and her late
mother, Eileen Spence, from Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation (formerly known
as Nelson House First Nation), while my father’s side comes from a mixed
European heritage. I am also a land user who has spent the better part
of the last 29 years hunting, fishing, and trapping all over western
Canada. My upbringing was guided by my father’s passion for the
outdoors, which instilled in me a profound respect for the land and
water along with the fish and wildlife that call it home. My
relationship with the natural world is not just an academic endeavour
but a deeply personal and spiritual journey that has shaped my life and
identity from a young age. I was raised in a household where hunting,
fishing, and trapping were not only sustenance-based activities but also
acts of cultural preservation. Through these experiences, I have seen
Bison not only as an ecological and cultural keystone species but also
as a relative whose presence is intertwined with Indigenous identities
across Turtle Island. - Remington Bracher

<p><strong>Is it Buffalo or Bison?</strong></p>
<p>Bison are commonly known as Buffalo. Bison and Buffalo are the same
animal. The words are often used interchangeably. You can say Buffalo is
the common name and Bison is the scientific name (<em>Bison bison</em>).
Buffalo are the largest land mammal found in North America. There are
two types of Buffalo in Canada, the Wood Buffalo and the Plains
Buffalo.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p><strong>Wood Buffalo vs Plains Buffalo</strong></p>
<p>Currently, <strong>Wood Buffalo</strong> (<em>Bison bison bison</em>)
is listed as Threatened and classified as ‘wildlife’ only in British
Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, and the Northwest Territories. Meanwhile,
<strong>Plains Buffalo</strong> (<em>Bison bison athabascae</em>) is
listed as ‘Special Concern’ and are not protected under the Species at
Risk Act (SARA) in Canada. They are only classified as ‘wildlife’ in
British Columbia and Saskatchewan and as ‘livestock’ in Alberta and
Manitoba.</p>
<p>The Wood Buffalo is larger compared to the Plains Buffalo.</p>

<strong>Reintroduction Program</strong>
</h1>
</center>
<p>The Plains Bison was completely lost in Canada until a herd (Elk
Island herd) was brought from Montana. This was regarded as one of the
biggest conservation initiative that Canada has ever done. It started
from 34 individuals. The most recent one was the <a

Buffalo was brought to Banff National Park. As of 2024, there are over
130 individuals roaming the park. For information, check out the <a

<p>Since time immemorial, Indigenous communities across North America
have relied on wildlife to support their ways of life. Regionally
abundant species that are fundamental to communities’ diets, materials,
medicine, art, and spiritual practices have been referred to as Cultural
Keystone Species (CKS) <a
href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-00669-090301">(Garibaldi &amp;
Turner, 2004)</a>.</p>
<p>The loss of Buffalo has impacted Indigenous food sovereignty and
these communities’ cultural practices, language, and knowledge
transmission (Lamb et al., 2023). As conservation values, ethics, and
initiatives started to recognize the importance of Buffalo on the
landscape, we also witnessed the significance of National Parks in the
species conservation story.</p>
<!-- 
These parks have played a pivotal role in Bison conservation (Boyd & Gates, 2004) and have now reintroduced Bison in seven national parks across western Canada. 



In some cases, such as Banff National Park, these reintroductions have espoused reconciliation as an underlying motivation to 'bring back the bison.' At the same time, Canada's national park agencies participate in the systematic removal and exclusion of Indigenous communities from their traditional territories and practices (Vranich, 2023), thus severing their connection to the land and impacting generations of Indigenous people in the process. Historic parks and protected areas legislation was rooted in colonial beliefs that fundamentally separated people from the land, reinforcing the outdated ideas of pristine wilderness or fortress conservation. 

The federal government has committed to reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples through renewed, nation-to-nation and government-to-government relationships based on the recognition of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership (GoC; CIRNAC, 2024). However, reconciliation requires more than rebalancing the relationship between Indigenous and Non-indigenous people across Canada it also requires a shift in governing power structures and decision-making processes which decides what knowledge is recognized as valid (Nadasdy 2003). A change could be on the horizon; Parks Canada's new policy on Indigenous Stewardship, The Buffalo Treaty and the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People in Canada could shift current management of wildlife and National Parks through the recognition of treaty rights towards a more rights-based approach and a more Indigenized model of wildlife conservation (Hessami et al., 2021). 

</br>



<center> <h1> **Restoring Cultural Meaningful Hunting of Buffalo in National Parks** </h1> </center>

In contemporary wildlife literature, an emerging Indigenous research paradigm emphasizes braiding of Traditional Ecological Knowledge with western science (Wilson 2008, Lamb et al., 2023, Hessami et al, 2021); recognition of Indigenous Food Sovereignty to community health (Ray et al., 2019); and how co-governance of wildlife resource is essential to Indigenizing the North American model of Wildlife Conservation (Hessami et al., 2021). TEK research highlights the interconnected ecological relationships between people, wildlife, plants, and land stewardship practices such as hunting and cultural fire all influence ecological patterns across the landscape (Nelson & Shilling, 2018; Goode et al., 2022). Discussions on food sovereignty underscore the health benefits of traditional foods, the sustainability of wildlife populations, and the importance of Indigenous-led stewardship and community involvement (Abdul et al., 2024). Meanwhile, cooperative management approaches, such as Parks Canada Advisory Circles and Indigenous Guardians programs, are increasingly recognized as essential tools for reconciliation, self-determination, and collaborative conservation efforts across Canada. 



<center> <h1> **Braiding Traditional Ecology knowledge and Western Science** </h1> </center>

While reconciliation is a focus for the Canadian government, it should also be at the forefront of the minds of natural resource researchers in academia (Wong et al., 2020). Reconciliation between research institutions and Indigenous communities addresses years of colonial practices that were extractive in nature, where sacred knowledge was published without the consent of communities and relabeled as a "new" scientific discovery. In this context, reconciliation requires exploring opportunities for data sovereignty and building relationships based on mutual respect and reciprocity so that both Indigenous communities and scientists benefit from publicly funded research (McGregor, 2017). As natural resource scientists, we also have the opportunity to foster and mentor future generations of Indigenous researchers (Wong et al., 2020), given the strong connections between Indigenous peoples and researchers in relation to the land and ecosystems (Berkes, 2017; Ban et al., 2018).

Master of Science student at the University of British Columbia at
Okanagan campus, which is located on the unceded and ancestral land of
the Syilx Okanagan First Nation in Dr. Adam Ford’s Wildlife Restoration
Ecology (WiRE) Lab. My academic background includes a Bachelor of
Science in Environmental and Conservation Sciences from the University
of Alberta and a technical diploma in Conservation Biology from the
Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. In addition to formal
education, my knowledge has been shaped by my experiences as a land user
and the cultural teachings I received throughout my life. As an
Indigenous researcher, I recognize that my research is not just a
contribution to academia but also serves the needs and priorities of
Indigenous communities working towards self-determination. </br></p>

research focus is in behavioural ecology. I am currently studying the
behavioural response of mountain goats in Cathedral Provincial Park to
wildfire during the Crater Creek wildfire in 2023. My contribution to
